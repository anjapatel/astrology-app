      Virgos are always paying attention to the smallest details and their deep sense of humanity makes them one of the
      most
      careful signs of the zodiac. Their methodical approach to life ensures that nothing is left to chance, and
      although
      they are often tender, their heart might be closed for the outer world. This is a sign often misunderstood, not
      because
      they lack the ability to express, but because they wonâ€™t accept their feelings as valid, true, or even relevant
      when
      opposed to reason. The symbolism behind the name speaks well of their nature, born with a feeling they are
      experiencing
      everything for the first time.
